    # Cifrador César — GitHub Pages Ready

This repository contains a static web page implementing a Caesar cipher compatible with Spanish characters (ñ, accents) and English.

Usage:
1. Push to `main` branch.
2. The included GitHub Actions workflow will package and deploy the site to GitHub Pages automatically.

You can also open `index.html` locally to test the UI, or run `python3 test_runner.py` to execute automated tests.
